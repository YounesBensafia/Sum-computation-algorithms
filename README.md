# Sum Computation Algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains two different algorithms for calculating a sum, aimed at comparing their time complexities. 
The goal is to investigate how each algorithm performs as the input size \( n \) increases. The repository includes the following:

- **Two sum computation algorithms** with different time complexities.
- **Data collection** on execution times for varying input sizes.
- **Graphs** that visualize the performance difference between the two algorithms.
